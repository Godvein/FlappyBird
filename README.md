# Flappy Bird - C++ SFML

A clone of the classic **Flappy Bird** game, developed using **C++** and **SFML**. This project demonstrates fundamental game development concepts, including physics simulation, input handling, collision detection, and basic game loop mechanics.

## **About the Project**
Flappy Bird is a simple yet challenging game where the player controls a bird that flaps its wings to navigate through a series of obstacles (pipes). The objective is to pass through as many pipes as possible without colliding with them or the ground.

## How to Download and Play
You can find the .zip file on the release section for windows and linux. The game was primarily made for linux so it might have some bugs in windows.
