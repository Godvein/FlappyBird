# Flappy Bird - C++ SFML

A clone of the classic **Flappy Bird** game, developed using **C++** and **SFML**. This project demonstrates fundamental game development concepts, including physics simulation, input handling, collision detection, and basic game loop mechanics.

## **About the Project**
Flappy Bird is a simple yet challenging game where the player controls a bird that flaps its wings to navigate through a series of obstacles (pipes). The objective is to pass through as many pipes as possible without colliding with them or the ground.
